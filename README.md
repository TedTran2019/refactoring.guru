Just going through the Refactoring.guru website and jotting down my thoughts

## Purpose

Most of these won't be used because well, a lot of the problems that the GoF patterns try to solve have already been designed out of the language itself. However, it's still useful to learn these patterns
and understand them for inspiration. After this, I'll probably be going through the two books:
"Design Patterns in Ruby", "Refactoring: Ruby Edition", and "Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby" for more Ruby specific knowledge.

A useful tip I think is to not get stuck in an OOP approach as well-- design patterns themselves are like data structures, they can be implemented in different ways.
